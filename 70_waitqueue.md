# Brief

A wait queue in the Linux kernel is a fundamental mechanism used to manage processes or thread that need to wait for a resource or event before continuing execution. Instead of busy-waiting (constantly checking if a condition is met), a process can sleep on a wait queue and be efficiently woken up when the resource becomes available.

- A wait queue is essentially a linked list of waiting processes, each represented by a structure that holds a pointer to the process's `task_struct` and a pointer to the next element in the queue.
- Processes added to a wait queue can be in either an (signal) interruptible or uninterruptable sleep state. Interruptible sleep can be interrupted by **signals**, while uninterruptible sleep cannot
- When a process needs to wait (e.g., for I/O or lock), it is added to a wait queue and put to sleep. The scheduler will suspend the process until it its explicitly woken up, usually when the awaited resource is available.
- When the event occurs, the kernel wakes up processes on the wait queue, setting their state to running so they can be scheduled again. The process removes itself from the wait queue when it resumes.
- Wait queues are for synchronizing access to resources and are a **building block** for higher-level synchronization primitives like semaphores.


```c
wait_queue_head_t my_queue;
init_waitqueue_head(&my_queue);

wait_event_interruptible(my_queue, condition_is_true());
/* The process sleeps here until condition_is_true() becomes true */

/* When condition becomes true */
wake_up_interruptable(&my_queue);
```

### try_to_wake_up

```c
/**
 * try_to_wake_up - wake up a thread
 * @p: the thread to be awakened
 * @state: the mask of task states that can be woken
 * @wake_flags: wake modifier flags (WF_*)
 *
 * Conceptually does:
 *
 *   If (@state & @p->state) @p->state = TASK_RUNNING.
 *
 * If the task was not queued/runnable, also place it back on a runqueue.
 *
 * This function is atomic against schedule() which would dequeue the task.
 *
 * It issues a full memory barrier before accessing @p->state, see the comment
 * with set_current_state().
 *
 * Uses p->pi_lock to serialize against concurrent wake-ups.
 *
 * Relies on p->pi_lock stabilizing:
 *  - p->sched_class
 *  - p->cpus_ptr
 *  - p->sched_task_group
 * in order to do migration, see its use of select_task_rq()/set_task_cpu().
 *
 * Tries really hard to only take one task_rq(p)->lock for performance.
 * Takes rq->lock in:
 *  - ttwu_runnable()    -- old rq, unavoidable, see comment there;
 *  - ttwu_queue()       -- new rq, for enqueue of the task;
 *  - psi_ttwu_dequeue() -- much sadness :-( accounting will kill us.
 *
 * As a consequence we race really badly with just about everything. See the
 * many memory barriers and their comments for details.
 *
 * Return: %true if @p->state changes (an actual wakeup was done),
 *	   %false otherwise.
